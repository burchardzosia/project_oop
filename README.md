-the size of the map
-number of grasses

-energy for animal
-extra added energy after eating grass
-number of grasses growing every day
-age when animal is ready to reproduce
-length of genome
-map type (earth-sides are merged, infernal portal- when you cross the border,you will be teleported to a random location)
-mutation type(small-new animal has the same type of genome like parents , ig-the new animal has partially changed the genome)
-behavior type(normal-next move is based on the following genome, crazy- next move is based on the random genome)
# Game
Animal with more energy has pariority to eat grass or to reproduce.
